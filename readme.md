# Bike Pump Finder

"Bike-Pump-Finder" is a web application developed using vanilla JavaScript that leverages Bristol Open Data to help users locate bike pumps in and around Bristol. The application provides users with comprehensive details about each bike pump, including nearby parking spaces, the number of available parking spots, Google ratings, and operational status. Users can view the locations of bike pumps on a map, add reviews, and access real-time information about bike pumps in their vicinity. This tool aims to enhance the cycling experience by making essential services easily accessible.

It uses Public [Bike Pump Data](https://opendata.bristol.gov.uk/explore/dataset/public-bike-pumps/information/) 
from [Open Data Bristol](https://opendata.bristol.gov.uk).
